  Fault-Tolerant Leader-based Publish/Subscribe Replication System
</h1>


## Overview[![pin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60201466/166403770-b5813248-17d5-4b23-acfe-cf60936d539f.svg)](#overview)

**TURTLE TUBE** is a reliable stream processing communication engine to enable ingesting and processing data in real-time within a distributed system.

## Motivation[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60201466/166403770-b5813248-17d5-4b23-acfe-cf60936d539f.svg)](#motivation)

For the final project, I would like to implement a set of the additional feature options that I have not implemented in managing communication within a distributed network. I believe that by completing the suggested features, I can learn more about reliability, fault-tolerant, leader-based replication, and consistency in a publish/subscribe system fully as the course intended. I named this project Turtle Tube with the hope that slow and steady wins the race.

## Composition[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60201466/166403770-b5813248-17d5-4b23-acfe-cf60936d539f.svg)](#composition)

> ðŸ’¡ In current version, the TURTLE TUBE pub/sub system handles:

* Membership and failure detection using the bully algorithm and heartbeat gossiping system
* Reliability using ACK approach
* Inject failure to handle latency
* Synchronous and partial asynchronous replication 
* Leader-based system using bully election
* Dynamically add new instances of the Broker during program execution
* A pull-based Consumer API similar to the original Kafka design.

The TURTLE TUBE engine guaranties that:
* The crash-stop failure of one application does not cause the crash of the system.
* The consumer are automatically notified about available leader status.
* All followers will catch up with replication during the join procedure
* Strong consistency, a consumer must receive all messages in order.
* Work over the Lossy connection.

## Proposed Features [![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60201466/166403770-b5813248-17d5-4b23-acfe-cf60936d539f.svg)](#proposed-features)

_Here are the TURTLE TUBE proposed features:_
| Features | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Persist Log to Disk and Use Byte Offsets as Message IDs**| Flush the segment files to disk only after a configurable number of messages have been published.|
|**Push-based Subscriber**| a Consumer to be push-based and the Broker be stateful. |
|**Partitioning**| Each topic may have multiple partitions, and each partition may be handled by a different Broker.|
|**Pull-based reads from followers**| A Consumer may connect to a follower to subscribe to a topic.|

## Milestones [![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60201466/166403770-b5813248-17d5-4b23-acfe-cf60936d539f.svg)](#milestones)

TURTLE TUBE milestones:
1. **May 7** - **Improving Current Implementation** Implement instructor and peer-review feedback, fix bugs if there is any.
2. **May 9** - **Persist Log to Disk and Use Byte Offsets as Message ID** This includes implementation in replication.
3. **May 12** - **Push-based Subscriber** Design and implement a mechanism for a Consumer to register to receive updates to a topic. The Broker will proactively push out new messages to any registered consumers.
4. **May 14** - **Pull-based reads from followers** The Consumer will reconnect to active followers and specify its start point in the message stream
5. **May 17** - **Partitioning** This will be a tough one especially with replication.
